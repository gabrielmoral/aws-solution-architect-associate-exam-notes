#### S3

**Storage**
-   Object based storage.
-   Files are stored in buckets.
-   From 0 to 5GB files. Single PUT of 5 GB.
-   Unlimited storage.
-   Key-Value pair storage:
    - Key: Name of the object.
    - Value: Data of the object in bytes.
    - Version ID: when versioning.
    - Metadata: Data about data.

**Classes of storage**
-   S3 Standard:
    - 99.99% availability.
    - 99.999999999% durability.
-   S3 Intelligent Tier:
    - 99.90% availability.
    - 99.999999999% durability.
    - Uses machine learning to move the objects.
-   S3-IA (Infrequently Accessed):
    - 99.90% availability.
    - 99.999999999% durability.
    - Lower fee that S3 standard but charged per retrieval.
-   S3 One Zone-IA:
    - 99.5% availability.
    - 99.999999999% durability.
    - Lowest cost option but only 1 AZ.
-   S3 Glacier:
    - Retrieval time from minutes to hours.
    - To initiate an archive retrieval job you use the [Initiate Job (POST jobs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-initiate-job-post.html) REST API or the equivalent in the AWS CLI, or AWS SDKS.
    - Expedite, Standard and Bulk are the options to retrieve data from Glacier. 
    - Provisioned capacity ensures that your retrieval capacity for expedited retrievals is available when you need it.
    - You cannot directly upload archives to Glacier by using the management console. To upload data, you must either use the AWS CLI or write code to make requests, by using either the REST API directly or by using the AWS SDKs. 
-   S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
    - Retrieval time of 12 hours.
    - Lowest cost storage class.

**Buckets**
- By default there is a soft limit of 100 buckets per account that can be increased visiting AWS service limits.
- By default are private.
- Names are unique globally.
- Access control is setup using Bucket Policies and ACL.
- Can be configured to create access logs with the log requests made to the bucket. They give detailed information about every access request sent to the S3 bucket including the referrer and turn-around time information. The logs can be sent to another bucket or even another account.

**Bucket names restrictions**
No ips, at least 3 chars, no more than 63 characters, no uppercase, must start with a lowercase letter or number, must not contain underscores.

**Consistency**
- Read after write for PUTS for new Objects.
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES.

**Encryption**
- At transit by SSL/TLS.
- At rest server side:
  - S3 managed keys SSE-S3.
  - AWS KMS, Managed Keys SSE-KMS. It provides an audit trail about that shows when your CMK was used by whom.
  - With customer provided keys SSE-C.
- At rest client side:
  - Client side encryption.

**Cross region replication**
- The object metadata and the ACLs are also replicated.
- It is possible to activate CRR for just a subset of object in a bucket.
- Versioning must be activated.
- Region must be different.
- Files in a existing bucket are not replicated automatically.
- Delete markers are not replicated.
- Delete individual versions are not replicated.
- Objects created with SSE-C encryption keys cannot be CRR.
- The objects that were already by CRR cannot be replicated again.

**Lifecycle policies**
- Automatically moves objects between different storage tiers

**S3 Transfer Acceleration**
- Uses edge locations for the users to upload files in S3 quickly.

**Snowball**
- It is a physical device to move data in and out to AWS.
- Snowball 72 TB usable max, Snowball Edge 83 TB max.
- Snowball Edge has compute capacity.
