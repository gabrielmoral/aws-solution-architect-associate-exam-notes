#### SWF (Simple Workflow Service)

It is a web service that makes easy to coordinate work across distributed application components.

Tasks represent invocations of various processing steps in an app as executable code, web service calls and human actions.

A task is assigned only once and is never duplicated.

Workflow executions can last up to 1 year.

It keeps track of all the tasks and events in the application, with SQS the application needs to implement it.
