#### Lambda

AWS Lambda is a compute service where you can upload your code and create a Lambda function. AWS Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code.

You don't have to worry about operating systems, patching, scaling, etc.

- It scales out automatically.
- It is serverless.
- Lambda functions can trigger other functions.
- AWS X-ray allows you to debug what is happening.
- Function timeout is 15 minutes.
- Can be executed synchronously or asynchronously.
